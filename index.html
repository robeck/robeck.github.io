    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> This study aims to evaluate the systemic importance of corporations in the Chinese A-share market using dynamic multilayer complex networks and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. The dynamic multilayer financial network consists of a tail risk network established with quantile regression and a trading information network constructed with principal component analysis. Regarding network structure, the topological indicators of multilayer networks are more sensitive to systemic financial risk than those of single-layer networks. Subsequently, by combining multidimensional complex network theory with the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), the systemic importance evaluation (SIE) is evaluated.</p></div><br>

  Abstract
</button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>This paper evaluates how investor sentiment contributes to explaining the idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL) anomaly from a firm-level perspective in the Chinese stock market. This study employs the principal component analysis method to construct firm-specific investor sentiment (FSIS) and analyzes the effects of investor sentiment on the IVOL anomaly. In contrast to market-level sentiment, FSIS, as a varying cross-sectional sentiment indicator, can contribute to interpreting the idiosyncratic volatility anomaly from a micro- and portfolio-level viewpoint. According to our empirical investigation, stocks with higher FSIS have lower IVOL returns, i.e., a significant positive correlation exists between FSIS and IVOL.  </p></div>

<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>The work aims to explore a microscopic observation system of paper surface and achieve high-precision stereoscopic observation with detail characterization of paper surface morphology. Based on the DT-400E precision program-controlled three-dimensional translation stage and KEYENCE LJV-7200 two-dimensional laser scanner, the hardware parts of our own system are developed to scan and transmit point cloud data of paper surface morphology to the computer. The corresponding system software will automatically process the point cloud data acquired from the laser scanner and generate the corresponding vivid 3D model and height histogram. This system scans and characterizes four different types of paper samples, allowing the human eye to visually distinguish the differences in surface morphology as well as automatically calculate the numerical differences in paper surface morphology parameters. The results of the applicability test show that the system is highly efficient in acquiring, observing, and evaluating the topography of the paper surface. The system can not only predict the paper surface quality of printed paper, but can also be extended to the evaluation of 3D printed surfaces.  </p></div>

  Abstract
</button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>An optical film integrating microlens array (MLAs) and 3D micro-graphics is an important way to achieve the naked-eye 3D display effect. The 3D micro-graphics is traditionally generated by the micro-nano imprint technology based on precision engraving mold, which leads to high production cost and low production efficiency, and thus restricts the rapid response to production tasks and large-scale popularization and application. In this study, a process scheme for large-scale printing of 3D micro-graphics using UV offset printing based on presensitized (PS) plate was proposed, matching with the MLAs fabricated by micro-nano imprint process to achieve naked-eye 3D display effect. We used the laser confocal microscope to systematically measure and analyze the geometric and optical performance of the fabricated MLAs in terms of height, curvature radius, center distance, spacing, focal length, and numerical aperture, and evaluated the influence of the publishing resolution of the PS plate on the display effect of 3D micro-graphics. The printing quality and display effect of 3D micro-graphics were further improved by adjusting process parameters such as printing speed and printing pressure. The results of the current study demonstrate that the combined application of micro-nano imprint technology based on precision mold and UV offset printing technology based on PS plate can achieve an excellent naked-eye 3D display effect in 360° all angles, which is efficient, cost-saving, and highly flexible.  </p></div>

  Abstract
</button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>The powder-based 3DP (3D printing) technique has developed rapidly in creative and customized industries on account of it’s uniqueness, such as low energy consumption, cheap consumables, and non-existent exhaust emissions. Moreover, it could actualize full-color 3D printing. However, the printing time and size are both in need of upgrade using ready printers, especially for large-size 3D printing objects. Given the above issues, the effects of height and monolayer area on printing time were explored and the quantitative relationship was given in this paper conducted on the specimens with a certain gradient. On this basis, an XYX rotation method was proposed to minimize the printing time. The mechanical tests were conducted with three impregnation types as well as seven printing angles and combined with the characterization of surface structure based on the scanning electron microscope (SEM) digital images to explore the optimum parameters of cutting-bonding frame (CBF) applied to powder-based 3D printing. Then, four adhesives were compared in terms of the width of bonded gap and chromatic aberration. The results revealed that ColorBond impregnated specimens showed excellent mechanical properties which reached maximum when printed at 45° to Z axis, and α-cyanoacrylate is the most suitable adhesive to bond full-color powder-based models. Finally, an operation technological process was summarized to realize the rapid manufacturing of large-size full-color 3D printed objects.  </p></div>

<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>The goal of this experiment is to use UV ink as the modeling material to reproduce oil paintings with colorful three-dimensional features. The scanned picture of oil painting stored in bitmap format was sent into a software program that provided stratification processing. The layers were printed on paper or canvas using 3D print technology in the UV-LED ink-jet printer, with a sequence of positive and reverse outputs, and two output methods consisting of a combination of multilayer white ink with a layer of colored ink, and a combination of a layer of colored ink with multilayer transparent ink. The results indicated that replicating oil paintings with fine three-dimensional details and vivid color effects could be realized when the layers after stratification were printed out using a reverse sequence of multilayer white ink and colored ink. Therefore, UV ink-jet technology can successfully realize the reproduction of oil paintings with colorful three-dimensional features. </p></div>

  Abstract
</button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>The evaluation of technology projects for commercialization is intrinsically difficult but of great importance. In this paper, a project evaluation criteria and model are constructed in the following two aspects. Firstly, multi-level and multi-dimensional project evaluation criteria are formed with reference to various studies. These criteria help decision-makers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the technical level, maturity, implementability, promotion value, and industrialization foundation of the project. Secondly, since the evaluation of the project involves multiple criteria, it can be modeled as a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. A nested MCDM model for multi-level criteria is constructed using the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) algorithm with a hybrid of AHP and Entropy weighting methods. The results illustrate the effectiveness of the model in evaluating technology projects. The outcomes of the research enable decision-makers to comprehensively understand the projects based on multi-level criteria while making practical and rational decisions based on the evaluation model. </p></div>

<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>The present invention relates to a method for preparing a gas diffusion layer for a proton exchange membrane fuel cell and a product thereof, comprising coating a slurry of polydopamine grafted micronized carbon particles on the surface of a carbon paper by a rapid printing or coating technique; preparing a thin layer of graphene oxide on the surface of the carbon paper by layer-by-layer self-assembly using graphene oxide flakes; assembling to form a continuous mono- or multilayered thin film on the surface of the carbon paper using a nanocarbon spheres slurry; using a PTFE emulsion to treat the gas diffusion layer to form a low surface energy thin layer for deposition. Using polydopamine-modified conductive carbon black, graphene oxide and carbon nanosphere particles, there are differences in geometric characteristics between the three materials, layer by layer coating to form a gradient change in pore size structure, and at the same time, PTFE treatment to form a hydrophobic structure, through the construction of a gradient GDL to improve the gas diffusion layer conductivity of water, gas and improve the efficiency of the electrochemical reaction. The product carbon paper maintains good mechanical strength and is easy for subsequent processing and surface treatment operations.</p></div>
